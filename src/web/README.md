- Git

### Required Access Credentials
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-project-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=<development|staging|production>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-encryption-key>
```

## Security Setup

### API Key Management
1. Store all credentials in environment variables
2. Never commit `.env` files to version control
3. Use separate API keys for each environment

### Security Protocols
- Enable MFA for all development accounts
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd src/web
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
